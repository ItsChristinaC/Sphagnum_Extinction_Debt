# Extinction debt has outpaced colonization credit in peat mosses globally since 1900s

## Data availability

The ensemble weighted forest cover dataset as well as the species richness maps of mammals, amphibians and reptiles grouped by IUCN Red List categories constructed in the present study are publicly available here. 
The Sphagnum species occurrence data are available from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.xsvfpn), National Specimen Information Infrastructure (NSII; http://www.nsii.org.cn/2017/home-en.php), National Plant Specimen Resource Centre (NPSRC; http://www.cvh.ac.cn/), Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN; https://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/), and the ‘spocc’ R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spocc). Monthly climate data (1901-2020) were sourced from the WorldClim v2.1 database (http://www.worldclim.org/). Historical wetlands extent data (1901-2020) were obtained from reconstructed maps in Fluet-Chouinard et al. (2023), while forests and grassland extents data were derived from the HILDA+ dataset.
